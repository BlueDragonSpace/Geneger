Bugs:
	Level 9 Impulsed leftward

Must:
	Art and Music..
	
Should probably:
	Camera control for rooms
	Ranbow Shader (refer to notebook: HSV(n,100,100) and so on)
	
Want:
	Arrow Guide: Arrow Dot Path Midflight (Ballistics Plugin?)
	Multi-shot + Rapid fire lol
	Bomb Arrow, Key Arrow?
	Peggle Close Shot (likely gonna use Phantom Camera + Camera to Arrow) + Follow Path for better level coverage
	Boss fight scene!!! (Blowing wind, blowing targets to rejuvenate platforms, Hit eyes or something, cool music...)
	Breakable Object
	
Probably not:
	Collectible increases your draw speed, jump height...
	Puzzle?
	Arrow / Bow Enchanting?
	Arrow as a platform?
	Player arrows could be charged based on position in bow, rather than time of animation
	Center hit for points (would entail a points system, and how to figure out distance from center...)
	

Gimmicks?:
	Upside-down functions really well...

Mood...:
	Peaceful, Celeste Golden Feather Mix
	Bushes, Nature, Trees, Hills, Leaves

Music:
	wav files don't loop but mp3s do
	Reimport: 
		Arrow Going (loop by mp3)
		Wind (loop by mp3)
	Redo:
		Critical (high pitch)
		Jump (high pitch)
		Target (kinda just feels off)
	Add:
		Failure to Jump (puff of air) (show Celeste)
		Pause
		Out of Arrows
		Impulse
		Light Passage? (like an environment feature that opens up when you hit all targets and it's made of light)
		Next Lvl.
		Collecting Animation
	Unimplemented on my end:
		Start
