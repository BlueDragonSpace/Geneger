Must:
	Pause
	
	Art and Music... (gonna need making, and a lot of set-up)
	
	wav files don't loop but mp3s do
	Reimport: 
		Arrow Going (loop by mp3)
		Wind (loop by mp3)
	Redo:
		Critical (high pitch)
		Jump (high pitch)
	Add:
		Failure to Jump (puff of air) (show Celeste)
		Pause
		Out of Arrows
		Impulse
	Unimplemented on my end:
		Start
		
Should probably:
	Camera control for rooms
	Hit Switch Walls
	Loading Screen change (Shiba inspecific)
	Ranbow Shader (refer to notebook: HSV(n,100,100) and so on)
Want:
	Arrow Guide
	Multi-shot + Rapid fire lol
	Bomb Arrow, Key Arrow?
	Peggle Close Shot (likely gonna use Phantom Camera + Camera to Arrow) + Follow Path for better level coverage
	Arrow Dot Path Mid-flight
	Boss fight scene!!! (Blowing wind, blowing targets to rejuvenate platforms, Hit eyes or something, cool music...)
Probably not:
	Puzzle?
	Arrow / Bow Enchanting?
	Arrow as a platform?
	Player arrows could be charged based on position in bow, rather than time of animation
	Center hit for points (would entail a points system, and how to figure out distance from center...)

Gimmicks?:
	Upside-down functions really well...

Mood...:
	Peaceful, Celeste Golden Feather Mix
	Bushes, Nature, Trees, Hills, Leaves
