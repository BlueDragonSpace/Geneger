Must:
	Dead Screen
	Advance level on all targets hit
Should probably:
	Camera control for rooms
	Target num + (UI display)
	Moving Targets
	Hit Switch Walls
	Pixel Outline
	Loading Screen change (Shiba specific)
	Ranbow Shader (refer to notebook: HSV(n,100,100) and so on)
Want:
	Air Control
	Arrow Guide
	Multi-shot + Rapid fire lol
	Bomb Arrow, Key Arrow?
	Peggle Close Shot (likely gonna use Phantom Camera + Camera to Arrow) + Follow Path for better level coverage
	Arrow Dot Path Mid-flight
Probably not:
	Puzzle?
	Arrow / Bow Enchanting?
	Arrow as a platform?
	Player arrows could be charged based on position in bow, rather than time of animation
	Center hit for points (would entail a points system, and how to figure out distance from center...)

Gimmicks?:
	Upside-down functions really well...

Mood...:
	Peaceful, Celeste Golden Feather Mix
	Bushes, Nature, Trees, Hills, Leaves
