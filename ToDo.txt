Must:
	Art and Music...
	
Should probably:
	Camera control for rooms
	Ranbow Shader (refer to notebook: HSV(n,100,100) and so on)
	Speedrun time vs time spent
Want:
	Arrow Guide: Arrow Dot Path Midflight (Ballistics Plugin?)
	Multi-shot + Rapid fire lol
	Bomb Arrow, Key Arrow?
	Peggle Close Shot (likely gonna use Phantom Camera + Camera to Arrow) + Follow Path for better level coverage
	Boss fight scene!!! (Blowing wind, blowing targets to rejuvenate platforms, Hit eyes or something, cool music...)
	Breakable Object
	Controller Support (warning for trackpad?)
Probably not:
	Collectible increases your draw speed, jump height...
	Puzzle?
	Arrow / Bow Enchanting?
	Arrow as a platform?
	Player arrows could be charged based on position in bow, rather than time of animation
	Center hit for points (would entail a points system, and how to figure out distance from center...)
	

Gimmicks?:
	Upside-down functions really well...

Mood...:
	Peaceful, Celeste Golden Feather Mix
	Bushes, Nature, Trees, Hills, Leaves

Music:
	Liam's problem
	Unimplemented on my end:
		Start
