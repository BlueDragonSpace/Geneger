Must:
	Art and Music...
	
	Separate moving/non-moving platform arrow
Should probably:
	
	Camera control for rooms
	Ranbow Shader (refer to notebook: HSV(n,100,100) and so on)
Want:
	Arrow Guide: Arrow Dot Path Midflight (Ballistics Plugin?)
	Multi-shot + Rapid fire lol
	Bomb Arrow, Key Arrow?
	Peggle Close Shot (likely gonna use Phantom Camera + Camera to Arrow) + Follow Path for better level coverage
	Boss fight scene!!! (Blowing wind, blowing targets to rejuvenate platforms, Hit eyes or something, cool music...)
	Breakable Object
	Jump Buffer (jump when you pressed the button too early)
	Camera Peeking (hold down look down, hold up look up)
Probably not:
	Collectible increases your draw speed, jump height...
	Puzzle?
	Arrow / Bow Enchanting?
	Center hit for points (would entail a points system, and how to figure out distance from center...)

Refactoring: 
	Multiple inheritance for rigidbody arrows vs staticbody (platform) arrow
	Player arrows could be charged based on position in bow, rather than time of animations
	Each arrow as individual scene

Gimmicks?:
	Upside-down functions really well...

Mechanics:
	Platforming
	Bow + Arrow
	Bouncy
	Rope
	Switch-hit
	Wind
	Arrows: Anti-Grav, Ghost, Impulse

Mood...:
	Peaceful, Celeste Golden Feather Mix
	Bushes, Nature, Trees, Hills, Leaves

Music:
	Liam's problem
	Unimplemented on my end:
		Start
